\maketitle

This proposal describes our idea for the CS 551 final project. The goal of the
project is to create an AI system that, given words from a particular language,
will produce similar words based on the probabilities of different letters
following one another. For example, given a list of science-fiction names, it
could produce more words that ``sound like'' science-fiction names.

First we will declare a \textit{token} type that could be a single character,
digraph, or trigraph. From a test data set, the program will learn the
probabilities of tokens following each other, and use this data to create a
Markov model. Eventually, given a single token as input, the program should be
able to create words resembling the learning data set. We will implement this
project in the Go programming language.

Current implementations of similar projects use trivial methods like scrambling
data and then using random number generators. We are hoping that this method 
could have applications to natural language processing.

The project is hosted on https://github.com/vyasa/tolkienizer
